#The mapping is composed of a list of compute nodes. Each compute nodes has two elements:
#"compute_node": name to identify the compute node within the datacenter
#"ports": list of ports mapped to a switch for that compute node.
#The information to identify the SDN controller and the dataplane switch is obtained from the datacenter information
- compute_node:    "compute node 1"
  ports:
    #Each mapped port contains the following information:
    #"pci": pci address of the port in the compute node. This is a mandatory parameter
    #"switch_mac": MAC address of the corresponding port in the dataplane switch.
    #"switch_port": Openflow name of the port in the dataplane switch.
    #"switch_mac" or "switch_port" must be specified. Both of them could be specified
    - pci:         "0000:81:00.0"
      switch_port: "port-2/1"
    - pci:         "0000:81:00.1"
      switch_mac:  "52:54:00:94:21:22"
- compute_node:    "compute node 2"
  ports:
    - pci:         "0000:81:00.0"
      switch_port: "port-2/3"
      switch_mac:  "52:54:00:94:22:21"
    - pci:         "0000:81:00.1"
      switch_port: "port-2/4"
      switch_mac:  "52:54:00:94:22:22"
