	abstract = {This paper explores the economics of scalable network services by posing two simple questions. First, what is the difference between scale economies and scalability? Second, why and how should we scale network services for competition and cooperation? By answering these questions in the context of network services such as multicast, {QoS} and web caching, we gain some insight into the tradeoffs involved in the design of scalable network services.},

	abstract = {Scalability is said to be one of the major advantages brought by the cloud paradigm and, more speciﬁcally, the one that makes it diﬀerent to an “advanced outsourcing” solution. However, there are some important pending issues before making the dreamed automated scaling for applications come true. In this paper, the most notable initiatives towards whole application scalability in cloud environments are presented. We present relevant eﬀorts at the edge of state of the art technology, providing an encompassing overview of the trends they each follow. We also highlight pending challenges that will likely be addressed in new research eﬀorts and present an ideal scalable cloud system.},

	abstract = {In service-oriented computing, service consumers invoke services deployed by service providers, and service providers are liable to manage the quality of their services including scalability, availability and performance. Especially, scalability is hard to achieve, mainly due to the unknown nature of service consumers and unpredictable volumes of service invocations. Services with poor scalability would lose the consumer bases, resulting in low revenues. Conventional approaches to scalability of network, database, and distributed computing are hardware-oriented solutions. In this paper, we present software-oriented approaches to assuring high scalability of services in cloud computing. We first define scalability in service-oriented computing, present formal foundation of services scalability. Then, we present two effective scalability assuring schemes; service replication and migration. The proposed schemes are distinguished from conventional scalability schemes in three ways; tailored for service-oriented computing, software solutions rather than hardware solutions, and being implementable with current {SOA} and languages. To show the applicability of proposed schemes, we show a result of implementing the schemes and experiments with them. Using the methods, services scalability can be greatly enhanced dynamically by using software solutions.},
