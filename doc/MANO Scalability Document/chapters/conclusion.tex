\paragraph{}The main goal of this paper is to aggregate the factors affecting the scalability of a MANO. Scalability is an important factor in cloud environments which accommodates the demanding needs and also not affecting the systemâ€™s performance. The report further states the system load in terms of the load on the NFVO of a MANO. The scaling in a distributed MANO system is affected by the availability of a service and its reliable quotient. The report further describes the effect of diverse administrative domains of a MANO framework and how it can be addressed by a coherence mean. Scalability approaches from various research papers are discussed. This paper also discusses the architecture design of Translator, Splitter and Adaptor.


\paragraph{} The report further addresses the effects involved to scale a MANO, also briefing about scaling a network service. The further steps involved in the research is narrowing down to one of the scaling approaches to scale a MANO.
