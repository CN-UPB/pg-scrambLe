Pishahang-scramble integration enables the end users to instantiate a network service across multiple MANO frameworks. Each of the services developed by work-packages are functioning as per requirements and have been tested under various scenarios. The services are exposed, integrated with each other and with pishahang. The independent work packages themselves are capable of being used separately by other related projects. We believe that the work we carried out in this project will be useful for other MANO developers.
