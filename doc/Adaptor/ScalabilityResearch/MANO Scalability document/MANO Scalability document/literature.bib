Maintaining sufficient web resources just to meet performance during peak demands can be costly. Compute Cloud provides a powerful environment to allow dynamic scaling of web applications without the needs for user intervention. In this paper, we present a case study on the scalability and performance of web applications in a Cloud. We describe a novel dynamic scaling architecture with a frontend load-balancer for routing user requests to web applications deployed on virtual machine instances with the goal of maximizing resource utilization in instances while minimizing total number of instances. A scaling algorithm for automated provisioning of virtual resources based on threshold number of active user sessions will be introduced. The on-demand capability of the Cloud to rapidly provision and dynamically allocate resources to users will be discussed. Our work has demonstrated the compelling benefits of a Cloud which is capable of sustaining performance upon sudden load surges, delivering satisfactory {IT} resources on-demands to users, and maintaining high resource utilization, thus reducing infrastructure and management costs.},

	abstract = {ÐMany distributed systems must be scalable, meaning that they must be economically deployable in a wide range of sizes and configurations. This paper presents a scalability metric based on cost-effectiveness, where the effectiveness is a function of the system's throughput and its quality of service. It is part of a framework which also includes a scaling strategy for introducing changes as a function of a scale factor, and an automated virtual design optimization at each scale factor. This is an adaptation of concepts for scalability measures in parallel computing. Scalability is measured by the range of scale factors that give a satisfactory value of the metric, and good scalability is a joint property of the initial design and the scaling strategy. The results give insight into the scaling capacity of the designs, and into how to improve the design. A rapid simple bound on the metric is also described. The metric is demonstrated in this work by applying it to some well-known idealized systems, and to real prototypes of communications software.},

	abstract = {Quality of Service ({QoS}) information for Web services is essential to {QoS}-aware service management and composition. Currently, most {QoS}-aware solutions assume that the {QoS} for component services is readily available, and that the {QoS} for composite services can be computed from the {QoS} for component services. The issue of how to obtain the {QoS} for component services has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we tackle this fundamental issue. We argue that most of {QoS} metrics can be observed/computed based on service operations. We present the design and implementation of a high-performance {QoS} monitoring system. The system is driven by a {QoS} observation model that defines {IT}- and business-level metrics and associated evaluation formulas. Integrated into the {SOA} infrastructure at large, the monitoring system can detect and route service operational events systemically. Further, a modeldriven, hybrid compilation/interpretation approach is used in metric computation to process service operational events and maintain metrics efficiently. Experiments suggest that our system can support high event processing throughput and scales to the number of {CPUs}.},
