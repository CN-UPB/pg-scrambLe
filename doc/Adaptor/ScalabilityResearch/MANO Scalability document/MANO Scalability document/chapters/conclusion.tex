The main goal of this report is to aggregate all the factors affecting the scalability of a MANO generally. Scalability is an important factor in cloud environments which accommodates the demanding needs and also not affecting the systemâ€™s performance. The report further states the system load in terms of the load on the NFVO of a MANO. The scaling in a distributed system is affected by the availability of a service and its reliable quotient. The report further describes the effect of diverse administrative domains in a MANO framework and how it can be addressed by a coherence mean. Listed below are few of the scalability approaches which are aggregated from various research papers to tackle the challenges existing.

1.    Service Replication

2.    Service Migration

3.    Proactive Scaling

4.    Hierarchical Service Placement

5.    Reactive Scaling, and

6. 	  Service System Scaling



Further, by choosing one of the approaches and addressing the other factors, the research will continue.
