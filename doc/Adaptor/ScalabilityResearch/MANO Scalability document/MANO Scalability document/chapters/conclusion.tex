\paragraph{}The main goal of this report is to aggregate all the factors affecting the scalability of a MANO. Scalability is an important factor in cloud environments which accommodates the demanding needs and also not affecting the systemâ€™s performance. The report further states the system load in terms of the load on the NFVO of a MANO. The scaling in a distributed MANO system is affected by the availability of a service and its reliable quotient. The report further describes the effect of diverse administrative domains of a MANO framework and how it can be addressed by a coherence mean. Listed below are few of the scalability approaches which are aggregated from various research papers to tackle the challenges existing.

1.    Service Replication

2.    Service Migration

3.    Proactive Scaling

4.    Hierarchical Service Placement

5.    Reactive Scaling, and

6. 	  Service System Scaling


\paragraph{} The report further addresses the effects involved to scale a MANO, also briefing about scaling a network service. The further steps involved in the research is narrowing down to one of the scaling approaches to scale a MANO.
