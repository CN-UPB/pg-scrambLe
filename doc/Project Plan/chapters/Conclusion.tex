\label{ch:Conclusion}
As we discussed previously, there are many challenges to overcome and milestones to be achieved.
At the end our goal is to produce an end product, I.e. OSM adapter, NSD Splitter, NSD translator but 
We need an in depth knowledge on how we are going to produce it. The next steps for us is to use this document as a base and start reviewing all the technologies and decide upon which ones we have use, start designing and documenting the architecture which will be a foundation for our implementation.
Also in order to be efficient, we will be dividing the project group into sub-groups and independently work on various topics and each week discuss the progress of each sub-group and share knowledge and findings to rest of the team. Collaborate results of sub-groups to produce a stable end product.
