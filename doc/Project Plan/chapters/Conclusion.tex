As discussed previously, there are many challenges to overcome and milestones to be achieved.
In the end, the goal is to build an end product incorporating a MANO adaptor, NSD Splitter, and NSD translator. The next step is to use this document as a base and start reviewing all the technologies and decide upon which ones to incorporate. Design and documentation of the architecture which is the foundation to implement the project will begin.
The sub-groups will start their work independently on the intended modules,  Every week the progress of each sub-group is reviewed to share knowledge and findings with the rest of the team. Ultimately, we collaborate the results of the sub-groups to create a stable end product.
