As discussed previously, there are many challenges to overcome and milestones to be achieved.
At the end, the goal is to build an end product, i.e. OSM adaptor, NSD Splitter and NSD translator but 
an in-depth knowledge on how to achieve it is needed. The next step is to use this document as a base and start reviewing all the technologies and decide upon which ones to use. Design and documention of the architecture which is the foundation to implement the project will begin.
Also in order to be efficient, The project group is divided into sub-groups, to work independently on various topics. Every week the progress of each sub-group is reviewed toshare knowledge and findings to rest of the team. Ultimately, collaborate all the results of the sub-groups to produce a stable end product.
