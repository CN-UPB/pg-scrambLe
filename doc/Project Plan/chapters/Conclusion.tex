As discussed previously, there are many challenges to overcome and milestones to be achieved.
At the end, the goal is to build an end product incorporating a MANO adaptor, NSD Splitter and NSD translator but a deeper knowledge on how to achieve it is needed. The next step is to use this document as a base and start reviewing all the technologies and decide upon which ones to use. Design and documentation of the architecture which is the foundation to implement the project will begin.
Also in order to be efficient, the project group is divided into sub-groups, that work independently on the intended modules. Every week the progress of each sub-group is reviewed to share knowledge and findings with the rest of the team. Ultimately, collaborate the results of the sub-groups to create a stable end product.
