\chapter{Project Time Plan}
\label{ch:Project Time Plan}

In this chapter, the time plan for the project is discussed, which provides an overview of different tasks and what the team achieves for the course of one year. The intention of this timeline is to provide a rough idea over the tasks and their duration. The actual plan will be decided and defined as the project proceeds further. For better understanding, the main tasks of the project are divided as shown in the table below.

\end{table}

The following list further defines the goals of each task: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Project organization:}
	To establish communication between team members to understand each other, in terms of their skills set and expertise. Also, decide upon tools for project management, task management, version control and a platform for all further communications.
	\item \textbf{Preparation and Presentation of mini seminar:}
	To get an overview of various technologies and subjects that is required for the project. Select one of the subjects, research the subject in depth and present the concepts that are relevant to the project, to the team.
	\item \textbf{Developing project plan:}
	To combine all the subjects presented by each team member and make a basic sketch of what to achieve, how to achieve and by when to achieve it. For the project group, the document is a valuable reference to get an overview of the problem, related technologies and required sub-tasks. 
	\item \textbf{Reviewing technologies:}
	To list all the technologies that are relevant to the project, review pros and cons of each technology and to decide upon technologies to be used in the project.
	\item \textbf{Designing architecture:}
	To describe in precise on how the defined tasks are achieved for the end product of the project. This phase is one of the most crucial phases in the project group, as it is a core foundation to the project.
	\item \textbf{Implementation and Deployment:}
	To divide the project group into various sub-groups and each sub-group working independently to produce a stable product by the end of the implementation phase. This requires maximum efforts and time, as various versions/prototypes will be deveoped until a satisfying and stable end product is obtained. 
	\item \textbf{Presentation:}
	After implementing the system, it is presented to the supervisors. This is achieved by simulating some use cases and exemplary traffic on a running instance of the software suite.

The sequence of the tasks is visualized in the above diagram. Though the timeline mentioned is fixed and can change during the course of various phases of the project, this is to constantly remind the deadlines and to foresee further responsibilities and milestones to be achieved.
