\chapter{Project Time Plan}
\label{ch:Project Time Plan}

In this section, the time plan for the project is discussed, which provides an overview of different tasks and what the team achieves for the course of one year. The intention of this timeline is to provide a rough idea over the tasks and their duration. The actual plan will be decided and defined as the project proceeds further. For better understanding, the main tasks of the project are divided as shown in the table below.

\end{table}

The following list further defines the goals of each task: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Project organization:}
	To establish communication between team members to understand each other, in terms of their skills set and expertise. Also, decide upon tools for project management, task management, version control and a platform for all further communications. As an outcome, we have decided to use Gitlab for project, task management and for version control, Texstudio for documentation and Slack for internal communication.
	\item \textbf{Preparation and Presentation of mini seminar:}
	To get an overview of various technologies and subjects that is required for the project. Select one of the subjects, research the subject in depth and present the concepts that are relevant to the project, to the team.
	\item \textbf{Developing project plan:}
	To combine all the subjects presented by each team member and make a basic sketch of what to achieve, how to achieve and by when to achieve it. For the project group, the document is a valuable reference to get an overview of the problem, related technologies and required sub-tasks. 
	\item \textbf{Reviewing technologies:}
	To list all the technologies that are relevant to the project, review pros and cons of each technology and to decide upon technologies to be used in the project.
	\item \textbf{Designing architecture:}
 The aim here is to discuss, design and document the base for implementation. 	We have divided the project group into sub-groups who will decide on technologies and methods for implementation. The divided sub-groups is as follows.

		Suheel &  & Deeksha \\

\end{table}
	
	This phase is one of the most crucial phases in the project group, as it is a core foundation to the project.
	\item \textbf{Implementation and Deployment:}
	 Each sub-group working independently on their respective work packages and discuss the updates with team on weekly basis. Integrate and test the end product by benchmarking and by defining various scenarios where the product can be tested and to produce a stable product by the end of the implementation phase. This requires maximum efforts and time, as various versions/prototypes will be developed until a satisfying and stable end product is obtained. Implementation can be done in following stages.
	
		\begin{itemize}
		\item\textbf{Initial Development}: sub-groups working independently on respected packages.
		\item\textbf{Unit Test}: Conduct testing on each of the packages developed
		\item\textbf{Integration}: Integrate work of all the sub-groups.
		\item\textbf{Final Testing}: Use benchmarking and test the final product. 	
	\end{itemize}


	\item \textbf{Presentation:}
	After implementing the system, it is presented to the supervisors. This is achieved by presenting in document or pictorially the end results obtained by the produced developed. Present the learnings, challenges and benefits from the end product produced. 
	\end{enumerate}

The sequence of the tasks is visualized in the above diagram. Though the timeline mentioned is fixed and can change during the course of various phases of the project, this is to constantly remind the deadlines and to foresee further responsibilities and milestones to be achieved.
