	abstract = {The introduction of Network Function Virtualisation ({NFV}) represents a signiﬁcant change in networking technology, which may create new opportunities in terms of cost efﬁciency, operations, and service provisioning. Although not explicitly stated as an objective, the dependability of the services provided using this technology should be at least as good as conventional solutions. Logical centralisation, off-the-shelf computing platforms, and increased system complexity represent new dependability challenges relative to the state of the art. The core function of the network, with respect to failure and service management, is orchestration. The failure and misoperation of the {NFV} Orchestrator ({NFVO}) will have huge network-wide consequences. At the same time, {NFVO} is vulnerable to overload and design faults.},

	abstract = {{NFV} continues to draw immense attention from researchers in both industry and academia. By decoupling {NFs} from the physical equipment on which they run, {NFV} promises to reduce {CAPEX} and {OPEX}, make networks more scalable and flexible, and lead to increased service agility. However, despite the unprecedented interest it has gained, there are still obstacles that must be overcome before {NFV} can advance to reality in industrial deployments, let alone delivering on the anticipated gains. While doing so, important challenges associated with network and function {MANO} need to be addressed. In this article, we introduce {NFV} and give an overview of the {MANO} framework that has been proposed by {ETSI}. We then present representative projects and vendor products that focus on {MANO}, and discuss their features and relationship with the framework. Finally, we identify open {MANO} challenges as well as opportunities for future research.},

	shorttitle = {Network Service Orchestration},
	abstract = {Business models of network service providers are undergoing an evolving transformation fueled by vertical customer demands and technological advances such as 5G, Software Deﬁned Networking ({SDN}), and Network Function Virtualization ({NFV}). Emerging scenarios call for agile network services consuming network, storage, and compute resources across heterogeneous infrastructures and administrative domains. Coordinating resource control and service creation across interconnected domains and diverse technologies becomes a grand challenge. Research and development efforts are being devoted on enabling orchestration processes to automate, coordinate, and manage the deployment and operation of network services. In this survey, we delve into the topic of Network Service Orchestration ({NSO}) by reviewing the historical background, relevant research projects, enabling technologies, and standardization activities. We deﬁne key concepts and propose a taxonomy of {NSO} approaches and solutions to pave the way to the understanding of the diverse ongoing efforts towards the realization of multiple {NSO} application scenarios. Based on the analysis of the state of affairs, we ﬁnalize by discussing a series of open challenges and research opportunities, altogether contributing to a timely and comprehensive survey on the vibrant and strategic topic of network service orchestration.},

Network function virtualization ({NFV}) is proposed to address these issues by implementing network functions as pure software on commodity and general hardware. {NFV} allows ﬂexible provisioning, deployment, and centralized management of virtual network functions. Integrated with {SDN}, the software-deﬁned {NFV} architecture further offers agile trafﬁc steering and joint optimization of network functions and resources. This architecture beneﬁts a wide range of applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form of {NFV}. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the development of {NFV} under the software-deﬁned {NFV} architecture, with an emphasis on service chaining as its application. We ﬁrst introduce the software-deﬁned {NFV} architecture as the state of the art of {NFV} and present relationships between {NFV} and {SDN}. Then, we provide a historic view of the involvement from middlebox to {NFV}. Finally, we introduce signiﬁcant challenges and relevant solutions of {NFV}, and discuss its future research directions by different application domains.},

Network function virtualization ({NFV}) is introduced as a new methodology that offers a way out of this bottleneck. {NFV} is poised to change the core structure of telecommunications infrastructure to be more cost-efficient. In this article, we introduce an {NFV} framework, and discuss the challenges and requirements of its use in mobile networks. In particular, an {NFV} framework in the virtual environment is proposed. Moreover, in order to reduce signaling traffic and achieve better performance, this article proposes a criterion to bundle multiple functions of a virtualized evolved packet core in a single physical device or a group of adjacent devices. The analysis shows that the proposed grouping can reduce the network control traffic by 70 percent.},
