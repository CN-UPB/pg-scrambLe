	title = {5G {OS}: Control and Orchestration of Services on Multi-Domain Heterogeneous 5G Infrastructures},
	abstract = {A heterogeneous 5G infrastructure includes physical and virtual computation, storage, and networking resources, exploiting different technologies and spanning across several administrative domains. These resources can be combined into endto-end slices that can host different services. Services consist of virtual or physical elements and have different requirements, e.g., in terms of resource demands, latency, performance guarantees. The underlying resources need to be efﬁciently allocated to the slices and their corresponding services. To abstract away the complexities of the underlying 5G infrastructure and to provide the common functionalities required for efﬁcient and ﬂexible service and slice management and orchestration, we propose 5G Operating System (5G {OS}). We describe the requirements of such a system, present the high-level architecture of 5G {OS}, and describe the design challenges for different interfaces within 5G {OS}. Our proposed architecture includes scalable hierarchies of multi-domain and domain-speciﬁc slice and service orchestrators, software-deﬁned network controllers, and network function virtualization management and orchestration frameworks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03365},
	abstract = {The European Telecommunications Standards Institute ({ETSI}) developed Network Functions Virtualization ({NFV}) Management and Orchestration ({MANO}) framework. Within that framework, {NFV} orchestrator ({NFVO}) and Virtualized Network Function ({VNF}) Manager ({VNFM}) functional blocks are responsible for managing the lifecycle of network services and their associated {VNFs}. However, they face significant scalability and performance challenges in large-scale and geo-distributed {NFV} systems. Their number and location have major implications for the number of {VNFs} that can be accommodated and also for the overall system performance. {NFVO} and {VNFM} placement is therefore a key challenge due to its potential impact on the system scalability and performance. In this paper, we address the placement of {NFVO} and {VNFM} in large-scale and geo-distributed {NFV} infrastructure. We provide an integer linear programming formulation of the problem and propose a two-step placement algorithm to solve it. We also conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm.},

Although not explicitly stated as an objective, the dependability of the services provided using this technology should be at least as good as conventional solutions. Logical centralisation, off-the-shelf computing platforms, and increased system complexity represent new dependability challenges relative to the state of the art. The core function of the network, with respect to failure and service management, is orchestration. The failure and misoperation of the {NFV} Orchestrator ({NFVO}) will have huge network-wide consequences. At the same time, {NFVO} is vulnerable to overload and design faults.},

By decoupling {NFs} from the physical equipment on which they run, {NFV} promises to reduce {CAPEX} and {OPEX}, make networks more scalable and flexible, and lead to increased service agility. However, despite the unprecedented interest it has gained, there are still obstacles that must be overcome before {NFV} can advance to reality in industrial deployments, let alone delivering on the anticipated gains. While doing so, important challenges associated with network and function {MANO} need to be addressed. In this article, we introduce {NFV} and give an overview of the {MANO} framework that has been proposed by {ETSI}. We then present representative projects and vendor products that focus on {MANO}, and discuss their features and relationship with the framework. Finally, we identify open {MANO} challenges as well as opportunities for future research.},

Coordinating resource control and service creation across interconnected domains and diverse technologies becomes a grand challenge. Research and development efforts are being devoted on enabling orchestration processes to automate, coordinate, and manage the deployment and operation of network services. In this survey, we delve into the topic of Network Service Orchestration ({NSO}) by reviewing the historical background, relevant research projects, enabling technologies, and standardization activities. We deﬁne key concepts and propose a taxonomy of {NSO} approaches and solutions to pave the way to the understanding of the diverse ongoing efforts towards the realization of multiple {NSO} application scenarios.
