The main goal of this phase was to acquire practical experience on MANO frameworks and its workflow. All the steps required to instantiate a network service has been completed and verified. Currently, there are no means to add a MANO adopter to a main MANO instance which can communicate with other MANO frameworks to instantiate and monitor services running on them. The ability to do inter framework hierarchical orchestration is missing. Adding such an adopter will enable the MANO instances to scale according to the number of service requests. Therefore, implementing a MANO adaptor to tackle this issue is one of the milestones during the course of this project. MANO adopters for SONATA and OSM will be implemented first and OpenBaton would be considered in the next phase.
